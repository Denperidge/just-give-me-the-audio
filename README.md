# Just give me the audio
(Or the video, really)

A minimal nonsense youtube downloader. Simply copy the youtube link to your clipboard and run `mp3.bat`, or `wav.bat`, or...

No dependencies or extra setup necessary; a one-click install automatically downloads the latest yt-dlp & ffmpeg version, and you're good to go.

## Getting started
1. Download the latest release by [clicking here](https://github.com/Denperidge/just-give-me-the-audio/releases/latest/download/install.bat)
2. Run `install.bat` in a folder of your choice
3. Done! Now simply copy/CTRL+C any youtube link, and open `mp3.bat` (or whichever file format you want!) 

## How-To
### Add extra formats
To download in other formats, simply copy & paste any of the existing `*.bat` files, and rename them to the format you want. That's it!
